## Problem Domain
University life can be exciting, but it also comes with its own share of stress.  
Between academic pressure, financial worries, sleepless nights, and personal expectations, many students quietly struggle with their mental health.  
Over time, these challenges can build up and lead to feelings of anxiety, exhaustion, or even depression.

The purpose of this project was to look beyond grades and study hours —  
to see how everyday lifestyle habits and academic stress might be connected to a student’s emotional well-being.

While exploring the data, I tried to answer questions like:
- Are students who sleep less or feel more academic pressure more likely to experience depression?  
- Does a healthy diet or good study-life balance help improve mental health?  
- Can we spot early patterns that show when students might need more support?

This project isn’t about labeling or diagnosing anyone —  
it’s about understanding the bigger picture and starting a conversation around mental health awareness for students.

##  Project Workflow
1. Started with raw data (CSV)  I collected a dataset containing student lifestyle and stress factors.  
2. Used Python (Pandas) to read and upload the data into SQL Server for better management.  
3. Cleaned the data in SQL Server (Docker) fixed inconsistent values, standardized gender and sleep duration categories, and made it analysis-ready.  
4. Exported the cleaned table to Excel — so that Tableau could easily read and visualize it.  
5. Built interactive visuals in Tableau — to explore how sleep, study habits, and stress levels connect to student depression.


##  Key Insights

While exploring the data, a few clear patterns stood out:

- Students who slept less or felt more academic pressure showed more signs of depression.  
- Financial stress and family history also seemed to play a role in overall mental well-being.  
- On the other hand, good sleep, healthy habits, and balanced study routines were linked to happier, more stable students.
